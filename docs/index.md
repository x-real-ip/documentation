# Welcome to my Homelab documentation

Welcome to my homelab documentation!
This repository is where I keep track of my infrastructure setup, experiments, and automation work. My lab primarily runs on a Proxmox cluster with TrueNAS SCALE providing storage services. Kubernetes (k3s) to run my services. I use Ansible to automate deployments and manage tasks.

The goal of this documentation is twofold:

- To serve as a reference for my own environment and workflows.

- To share ideas, configurations, and lessons learned that may help others building or maintaining their own homelab.

Youâ€™ll find notes, guides, and code snippets related to virtualization, storage, automations, all tested and documented from my real-world setup.
