# Welcome to my Homelab documentation

This documentation is where I track my infrastructure setup, how-to's, cheatsheet, experiments and automation projects. My lab runs primarily on a Proxmox cluster with TrueNAS SCALE for storage and Kubernetes (k3s) for running services. I use Ansible to automate deployments and manage various operational tasks. Additionally, I follow a GitOps approach for Kubernetes using a [dedicated repository](https://github.com/x-real-ip/gitops) with ArgoCD to declaratively manage my services and configurations.

The goals of this documentation are twofold:

- To serve as a reference for my own environment and workflows.
- To share ideas, configurations, and lessons learned that may help others building or maintaining their own homelab.

Here, youâ€™ll find notes, guides, and code snippets covering virtualization, storage, and automation, all tested and documented from a real-world setup.
